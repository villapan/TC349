<h1>Critique</h1>
<p>
First, the website is minimal and immediately gets to point across and what their goal is: creating apps for Macs, iPhones, and iPads.  The site is very minimal because there is not much going on.  For instance, the developers use pictures and logos as links in order to communicate that each one leads you to a different website.  In addition, when you hover over one of the images, a pop-up will appear telling the user what each one does.  This is strategic of the developers since the website is primarily consists of images.  In addition, when the user clicks on the link and it brings them on a new page, intuitively the designers place a "panic" icon in the upper left corner that brings him back to the main page.

On the other hand, the placement of some designs, such as the red and purple triangles, does not really serve a purpose besides taking up space.  In addition, the design does not really fit aesthetically with the rest of the website, specifically the icon design.  In addition, the main text in the footer is difficult to read due to the dark text on the dark background.
