The Michigan State University home page uses clear headings in order to denote importance of objects.  For instance, the “Michigan State University” heading is larger than the rest, denoting the title of the website.  Smaller headings are used in order to break the web content off into different sections such as: MSU View, News, and Events.  The normal text is significantly different from that of headings in size and font-face.  This distinction makes the readability of the website easy on the eyes.  In addition, all of the text and links are readable and the user does not have to struggle to read any of the text.The navigation of the website is very clear and straightforward.  It is evident to the user that the top navigation bar will bring the user to different parts of the website.  In addition, when the user hovers over each link in the bar, more options appear.  It was also very convenient for the designers to place the search bar, and other important links relating to finding resources at Michigan State, in the upper right hand corner.  Finally, the layout of the website is very clean.  Not too much is going on at once so it doesn’t overwhelm the user.  The website as a whole is very appealing and follows a clear color scheme that bleeds Michigan State University: green, white, and bronze.
