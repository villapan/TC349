From the past lecture on css layouts, it is evident that this website follows a clear single column layout with a header that includes the companies logo and navigation bar, the content/body, and a footer.  The designer makes it very clear that this is how it is divided by using different shades of purple in order to indicate each feature of a single column layout.  In addition, the website is very usable and the user should not struggle finding what he needs from the website, because all of the links are very clear and highlighted by a contrasting bright purple.   The website is aesthetically appealing as it follows a monochromatic color scheme.  Graphically, it is evident to the user that heroku is a form origami, since the website uses different folded paper graphics in order to communicate its message. However at first it didn’t register to me at first that the “how it works” and “sign up” were beneath the main content, simply due to the fact that they want those two items to pop put to their users when they first enter the site.  Now I realize that not everyone may know what Heroku is and provides general information on how they operate as an organization before the user decides they want to use Heroku as a resource.The layout that I had chosen for my website is double column layout, because originally my website was oriented as a single column layout anyways.  I wanted to challenge myself to do a double column layout and make the layout fit my current content.  I placed navigation on the right side, and I had to place another section under it or else the composition of the site would feel unbalanced.
