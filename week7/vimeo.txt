What immediately struck me about Vimeo is that it does not follow a clear css layout.  However I see a combination of a single column layout and a gallery layout.  I believe this was done because Vimeo as an innovation site, and they look the break certain rules; however, I believe that breaking these rules are successful in this case.  Although it may seem like there is a lot of information on the site, the home page is clearly broken up into different sections either by colors of artwork; therefore, the user can easily navigate the site without feeling overwhelmed.  From a marketing perspective, the website strategically places a sign up area right under the header, but then it is placed again right before the footer.Graphically and aesthetically, the website is appealing to the eye.  All the text is very clear and big which allows for the user to read text without having to struggle to decipher letters.  Vimeo strives to get its point across.  Even though the website is broken up into different sections, certain graphics actually “break the border” and flow into the next element.  For instance, the designer creatively allows for the bark of the tree to extend to the “Watch the videos we love” section.
