	<h1>Aspirations</h1>
		<p>I am passionate about helping others.  I want to be able to use technology in order to aid others whether that be locally across the seas.  However, I do want to be able to travel to Africa one day, and do mission work for two weeks, and incorporate the use of technology.</p>
        <p>I also want to travel in general.  here's a list of places I would like to visit:
              <ul>
              	<li>Lupanga, Tanzani</li>
                <li>Germany</li>
                <li>Spain</li>
                <li>Australia</li>
        		<li>Philippines</li>
               </ul>
         <p>One of my goals is to go backpacking in Europe.  I really do want to travel the world and gain new perspectives!</p>
