            <h2>VISION AND DESIGN</h2>
                <p>Hello future employers! My name is Ken Villapando and <strong><em>I am an aspiring designer and developer who seeks to use the media and skills to ultimately better the world!</em></strong></p>  
                <p>I picked up web and graphic design when I was 15 year olds as a hobby, but now I want to make hobby and strong passion for working with technology in creative aspects.  I've always viewed design as an instrument that can immediately make its viewers think differently about how they see the world.  Social change designers such as <strong>GOOD magazine and Bruce Mau</strong> allowed me to view how powerful design can be.  My eyes were glued to graphics that portrayed high poverty rates in developing countries through innovative charts, graphs, and illustrations.   At this point in my life, I knew that I wanted to be a designer for social change; designs that will make people <strong>change perspectives.</strong></p>
            <h2>INSPIRATION AND INNOVATION</h2>
            	<p><strong><em>My drive to design and create is motivated by musicians, filmmakers, and artists who choose to push social norms and strive for excellence.</em></strong></p>
