The web developer program that I have chosen is Dreamweaver, mainly due to the fact that I am the most familiar with this program.  I have had several years of experience of working in Dreamweaver, so it’s also convenient for me. What I hope for is that since I am using this program in a more advanced class, it will help me maximize the potential of this program.I began to look more into the program to see if I could change the set-up of it, since it was inconvenient for coding and switching between Firefox and terminal.  Dreamweaver came with the option of choosing your layout depending on the goal of a project or personal preference of the user.  It was convenient that a “coding” layout was available.  It pulls up just the window for coding and an area to load style sheets.  In addition, I can scale the window horizontally so I have easier access to the Firefox an terminal window.
