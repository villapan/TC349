Immediately, this website is designed excellently mainly due to the fact that is simple and easily usable.  To elaborate, it is easy for the user to navigate the website.  The designer strategically places links in the upper right hand corner in a different, uppercase font that is distinct from the other fronts on the website.  In addition, the user can simply access the main page by clicking on the logo of the website.Next, the grid of the main page is clean and easily readable.  All the links, headings, and important text are aligned left, and pictures, videos, and captions are aligned neatly in a grid divided by a horizontal line.  In addition, the designer adds an arrow symbol next to the headings, which clues the user in that the link/arrow brings him to a different website.  The links are in large, readable sans serif font, while the lesser text is in a small, serif font.  This gives the user a feel of what text has more importance on a website.The only critique I have of this website is the footer.  Although the typography is clean and one can easily decipher the headers, I feel like there is a lot going on at once and there is a lot to process.  My eye doesn’t know where to focus first and I find it wandering while viewing the footer mainly due to the images.  The images are rather large, and feel out of place.  However, the combination of the grid alignment and the easily distinguishable headers does still allow for clarity and ease of navigation.
