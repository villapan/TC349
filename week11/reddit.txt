The mobile site that I will be analyzing is the mobile version of reddit.  I use reddit for various reasons, whether that’s looking at funny pictures or gaining insight on the latest technologies.  Personally, it’s handy for me to be able to access reddit at anytime.  The mobile version of reddit that I use is accessible for the user, and gets the job done.  I actually browse reddit more through my phone than I do on my actual laptop since it gets the job done and provides all of the content I need.First, there is a tool kit icon in the upper rand hand corner.  This is intuitive for a settings page that allows the user to login to his account.  Once the user logins in the icon reappears on the page, and instead of asking him to login, it brings him to his customized subreddit pages that he has subscribed to.  In addition, the layout is simplistic.  The mobile designers have it set-up so that each link takes up a rectangular section.  Each section includes the link/title, an upvote downvote button, an icon for showing comments, and another icon to share the link to other social media site.  Overall, reddit has created a mobile site that is easy for the users to navigate.
