My first reaction scrolling through Happy Cog was that there was a lot of information provided for just the home page; however, clicking on each link on the navigation bar brings you to each section of the page.  Happy Cog has all of their information laid out on a single page that is divided by sections.  This layout is beneficial since only one HTML page has to be created.  When the user clicks on one of the links, such as “blog,” the website will bring the user to that section.  Each section is divided by large, black headings, with a top and bottom dotted border.  This allows the user to organize the information into a hierarchy.  To elaborate, text that is not as important is smaller.However, there are a few aesthetic problems that do not appeal to me.  The header of the website is simply too large to my tasting.  There is a lot of negative space that is not being utilized well, specifically where the logo is located, which makes the header appear awkward and unappealing to user’s eye.  This is similar to the footer of the website.  To reiterate, there is too much space that is not being used.  The text, specifically follow us on twitter and Facebook links appear out of place.  On the other hand, the logo is in the shape of a cog, which conveys the message of the company very well.
