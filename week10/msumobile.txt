The home page of the mobile site is set-up in a way that is very accessible to the user.  It simply contains a search bar and icons/links that breaks up the MSU website into different sections if the user were to be browsing it through a computer.  This ultimately avoids the issue of having too much content that ends up being clattered on a small resolution screen.The content on each link on the site is also broken down into ways that are easy for the user to understand.  For instance, if one clicks on the Maps icon, the mobile site brings the user to a search bar that allows him to look for a certain building on campus.  After the search has been processed, the user then chooses the most accurate location from a list provided and an interactive map of the location on campus appears.However, I have several critiques for this website.  First, the footer is not on the homepage.  The footer includes a contact link that allows one to send an email to someone regarding an issue, if the question is not answered on the website.  In order for the user to access the footer, he must click on of the other links on the site.  In addition, navigating back to the homepage is not exactly intuitive.  Although the “MSU” button/link is provided in the upper left hand corner, it wouldn’t register to me that hitting the button that blends in with the header would appear to be a link.
