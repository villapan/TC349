Personally, the first item that pops out to me is the design of the infographics.   They are very strong and neat due to how the designer utilizes his color schemes.  The overall scheme of the website is appealing to the eye.  In addition, there is a lot of interactivity on the website, which makes it compelling.  As the user scrolls through the website, objects in the background also begin to move.The developer and designer of this website was also very strategic when it came to compiling the information for the site and then designing it.  It is evident that this site relies heavily on graphics to communicate their message: a site that provides an excellent service that creates charts at the user’s expense.  In addition, the use of text is minimal and exaggerated; however, there is a clear distinction between the headings and normal text.  This was purposely done due to the fact that if the headings and text were respectively at 24 pixels and 12 pixels, the style of the text would not work well with the website due to the very large graphics.  Although the website relies more on design as opposed to development to convey their message, the website follows a clear structure for the user.
