        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        	<p>The way I approached gathering the content cards was by simply accessing the sites top four navigation links: "create, about, blog, and contact." I was able to create about 30 different cards from each link. After exploring the website, I discovered that a Foldable is this customizable character made out of paper that was recently launched in early 2012. The character comes with many different customizations such as gender, hairstyle, and even the tiny character's ensemble. After one is done customizing the character, they can order the character. After making the categories and creating the content cards, I thought have others sort them into the groups would relatively be the same for each person in my test group.
<br />
<br />
The five different categories that I came up with were: shopping cart, contact, media, about, and creation. I had placed all information of paying for the physical object under shopping cart, ways to interact with Foldable.me under contact, media tools such as videos and pictures under media, basic information about the Foldable under about, and what kind of characteristics the user has in order to create the Foldable under creations. Therefore, my information resembles closely to that of the website. Immediately, this is how my head had organized the information; however, this was not the case when I had the test group organize the content into the groups.
<br />
<br />
First, I told every single participant the basic breakdown of a Foldable. There was only one participant whose results were very close to mine. However, the last two participants had results that greatly varied from each other and from my own. I believe this happened due to a misunderstanding of what a Foldable actually was, and especially since the participants did not get to view the site before hand. I also believe the group "creations" is very misleading and that did not translate well to the participants. My original intent of creations was being able to customize the tiny Foldable character.
<br />
<br />
Overall, I would have to reevaluate the groups that I have created; however, I do believe that the content is there. In addition, I could have also added another category for copyright information about the product, and what users have to agree to while accessing the website. </p>
