        <h2>Design</h2>
        	<p>The problem that I would like to tackle is creating a personal portfolio site.  What I want this site to ultimately portray is my best works in order to for certain employers to evaluate my work and consider me for their company.  Additionaly, I want to add a section about myself as to why I want to be a designer, why it's important to the world, and what I have to offer as a designer.</p>
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        	<p>The process for me gathering information on my own site was rather self-explanatory and I was able to create the content cards mostly by myself.  However, I did have to look at other portfolio sites just to see what kind of content they had included in their sites and tried to configure that in a way that information would fit into my portfolio site.  Ultimately, I had broken down the categories into were contact info, portfolio, about the designer, FAQ, resume, and one sub category called "different types of services provided."  However, after sorting all the content into categories I realized that I had "acknowledgements" and "search bar" unsorted at the end.  Having my test group sort the content helped me better understand where those cards could be sorted.
<br />
<br />
Again, after having my test group sort the content, their groupings varied from me.  What this means for me is that I have to be conscious about what I'm writing and how I decide to work certain phrases and groups.  While I was creating the cards, I tried to make sure that the card could only be sorted under one category, but again this was not the case.  This could be due to the fact that the test group was not exactly familiar with how portfolio sites operate.
<br />
<br />
For instance, each participant placed "photoshop work," "indesign work," "maya work," etc. under the portfolio.   What I was expecting was that the participants would sort that into the sub-category: "different types of services."  Again, this was probably due to the awkward wording.  What I could have done to make this clearer was changing the category to "programs that designer are experienced with."  In addition, I could have added content cards titled "freelance" and "company designer."  Therefore, it would clear the confusion of the sub-category card.  What I also noticed was that I had a content card "How to contact me" and that was sorted under contact information.  I actually expected that to go under FAQ.  However, what this implies is that I might simply have to discard that card altogether since it becomes repetitive.
