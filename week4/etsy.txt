	It is evident that Etsy is a site that has a lot to provide for its users just through the many, different categories that are in the left hand navigation bar.  It is also clear that the website has different sections by consistently using black headings.  The title of the website is simply placed in the upper left hand corner; however, it still stands out from the rest of the website.  It uses a contrasting orange background with white text.  The rest of the website uses either black text, or a button/navigation bar with a light grey background and blue text.  Since Etsy is a site for their users to buy their items, the designers strategically and graphically make the price text a green color.  What I also find compelling about this website is that every time you refresh the page, a new line-up of “handpicked items” appear.  However, the items that are displayed are shades and tints of a single color, which makes the website unpredictable, yet visually appealing at the same time.	The website itself is very usable and easy to navigate.  Although the many images that are displayed on the website may appear daunting at first to the user, simply clicking on the images and clicking on them again brings the user to the description and payment screen.  As previously stated, Etsy does provide a “categories” section in order for the user to find what she is looking for.  In addition, they also provide a search bar, just in case the user needs to look for a specific item.
