The United Pixelworkers website contains a clear navigation header.  The footer also reflects the same links as the header as soon as the user is done scrolling the entire page.  However, the designer added social media contact fields in the footer.  Finally, the shopping cart icon remains static on the page in order to remind the user to purchase one of their shirts.The layout of the website follows a clear gallery css style.  However, the information and content presented is personally daunting for me and seems as though the information placed is incoherent.  The first quarter of the site advertises promotional shirts, but the boxes and content seem out of place.  For instance, the two shirts that are featured are portrayed in a larger box.  However, the designer decided to use another large block in order to communicate to the user that it is a featured shirt.  The box descriptions that point to the shirts seem useless and are not a good use of space.  In addition, having them advertise a more shirts on the front page allows for no negative space.On the other hand, navigation pages follow a clearer layout that is easy for the user to understand.  Specifically, the shopping page has a navigation side bar that allows the user to categorize the shirts based on availability, sizes, and collections.
